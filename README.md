# PHP Projects
All PHP projects were done in Ubuntu. Projects 3 and 4 can be found hosted with EC2 from Amazon Web Services.

## Project 2
Simple program using OOP. Program runs, creates an invoice, 3 invoice items, and then calculates the invoice total
for all items.

## Project 3
PDO and the introduction of interfaces were the focus of this project. Index page for the project as all the standard
options for accessing a database. You are able to add a new task, view 1 or all tasks, update a task, and lastly delete
1 as well. The TaskManager implemented an interface requiring those specific methods and parameters.

## Project 4
For this project we moved into RESTful web services. Using the same database as project 3, instead of just posting every
submit, GET, PUT, and DELETE were used as well. There is a rudimentary user log in system. Only requiring you to add a username
to a databse and just putting that in to access the Task databse. It was not a requirment for the project, but something
I tried out on a whim on the side. As PUT and DELETE do not work directly, Chrome's POSTMAN was used to test PUT and DELETE.

## Wordpress
I included our small introduction to wordpress. Created a simple auto dealer website using wordpress. I created a child
template of the main template I was using so I could edit it as needed. I also created my own custom post types for
adding each new vehicle to the page.
